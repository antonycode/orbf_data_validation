Building the data into separate facilities
******************************************

The data consists in many facilities, that will be monitored. The data used to update the monitoring algorithms for each facility depends on the supervision trail that has been triggered. In order to efficiently keep track of each facility and of its trail, we transform the collected in a list of facilities objects with specific information stored, related to facilities.
