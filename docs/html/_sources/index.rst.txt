Monitoring OpenRBF data for strategic supervision
==============================================

This package is developped to help programs using OpenRBF to strategically orient their supervisions, and target their resources. The package has three main modules :

* **data_preparation** contains the utilities to format and prepare raw OpenRBF data for analysis
* **monitoring_algorithms** contains the utilities to create algorithms and simulate them
* **visualization** contains the utilities to visualize the results of the simulations, and analyze the outputs

A first description of the results can be found at  `Link text <../Analysis.html>`_
